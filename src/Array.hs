    Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.

    There are three types of edits that can be performed on 
    strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace 
    a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if 
    they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

        isOneEditAway "pale" "bake"  -> False
        isOneEditAway "pales" "pake" -> False

    Implement a method to perform basic string compression 
    using the counts of repeated characters. For example, 
    the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the
    "compressed" string would not become smaller than the 
    original string, your method should return the original 
    string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and 
    lowercase letters (a - z).

    Test Case: 
        compreString "aabcccccaaa" -> "a2b1c5a3"

        head holder: show (length holder) ++ compreStrHelper xs [x]

    Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one 
    word is a substring of another. Given two strings, sl and 
    s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of sl using 
    only one call to isSubstring (e.g.,"waterbottle" is a 
    rotation of"erbottlewat").

    s1 = xy = waterbottle
    x = wat
    y = erbottle
    s2 = xy = erbottlewat

    what about xyxy?
