    Binary Search Tree: 
    all left trees (values) <= Node n < all right trees (values)

    Balanced Tree: 
    the height of left and right subtrees of every node differ <= 1

    Full tree: 
    every node other than the leaves has two children.

    Complete tree:
    every level, except the last, is completely filled
    and the last level is filled from left to right

    Perfect Trees: 
    all nodes have two children 
    and all leaves have the same level.
